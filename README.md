# **Evaluation of Topic Modeling Techniques**

A comparative analysis of topic modeling techniques—**Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**, **Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI)**, and **Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)**—alongside the **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** technique, emphasizing the trade-offs involved in achieving enhanced domain-specific term identification and glossary development.

## **Abstract**  
The creation of domain-specific glossaries is vital for facilitating knowledge transfer and deepening understanding in specialized fields such as **medicine**, **law**, **finance**, and **science**. This research evaluates the effectiveness of various topic modeling techniques—**LDA**, **LSI**, and **HDP**—in extracting relevant terms for glossary construction across diverse domains.  

By employing metrics such as:  
- **Coherence**  
- **Interpretability**  
- **Completeness**  
- **Diversity**  
- **Semantic Similarity**  
- **Stability**  

...the study assesses the models’ capability to identify accurate and contextually meaningful terms. Furthermore, a comparative analysis with a **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** baseline, implemented using **spaCy**, highlights the strengths and limitations of these approaches.  

**Key Findings**:
- Significant trade-offs exist between **topic coherence**, **stability**, and **term diversity**, impacting the quality of glossary generation.
- These insights establish a foundation for improving NLP-based glossary development tools and emphasize the impact of technique selection on domain-specific applications.
