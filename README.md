# Evaluation-of-Topic-Modeling-Techniques
Performed a comparative analysis of topic modeling techniques, including LDA, LSI, and HDP, alongside the NER technique, emphasizing the trade-offs involved in achieving enhanced domain-specific term identification and glossary development.

## Abstract 
The development of domain-specific glossaries plays a pivotal role in facilitating knowledge transfer and enhancing comprehension in specialized fields such as medicine, law, finance, and science. This research explores the efficacy of various topic modeling techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), in extracting pertinent terms for glossary construction across diverse domains. By assessing these models using metrics such as topic coherence, interpretability, completeness, diversity, semantic similarity, and stability, their capability to identify accurate and contextually meaningful terms is evaluated. Furthermore, a detailed comparison with a named entity recognition (NER) baseline implemented through spaCy highlights the respective strengths and limitations of these methodologies. The findings reveal notable trade-offs between topic coherence, stability, and term diversity, providing valuable insights into optimal strategies for automated glossary generation. This study establishes a foundation for enhancing NLP-based glossary development tools and underscores the impact of selecting appropriate topic modeling techniques on the quality and reliability of identified terms in domain-specific applications.

#### NOTE: The code provided in this repository represents a foundational approach to the evaluation technique. The comparative analysis of topic modeling techniques requires the utilization of a comprehensive corpus sourced from diverse origins, coupled with the implementation of a robust methodology for result analysis and the formulation of conclusions.
