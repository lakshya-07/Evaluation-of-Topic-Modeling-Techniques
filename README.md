## Abstract 
The creation of domain-specific glossaries is essential for facilitating knowledge transfer and enhancing understanding in specialized areas such as medicine, law, finance, and science. This research examines the effectiveness of various topic modelling techniques—Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP)—in extracting relevant terms for glossary construction across diverse domains. By evaluating the models through metrics including topic coherence, interpretability, completeness, diversity, semantic similarity and stability we measure their capacity to identify accurate, contextually meaningful terms. A comprehensive comparison with a named entity recognition (NER) baseline using spaCy further underscores the relative strengths and weaknesses of these approaches. Our findings reveal significant trade-offs between topic coherence, stability, and term diversity, shedding light on the optimal strategies for automated glossary creation. This study lays the groundwork for advancing NLP-based glossary building tools and emphasizes how the choice of topic modelling technique impacts the quality and reliability of identified terms in domain-specific applications.
